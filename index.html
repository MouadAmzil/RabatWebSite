       <h1>KASBAH OUDAYAS</h1>
       <p>
        Built in the 12th century by the Almohads, it was originally called Mehdiya. It is the kasbah which gave its name to the city. The Ribat is in fact a fortified convent and it is here that the monks-soldiers who went to a holy war in Spain against the Christians settled.<br>
         When the Moriscos, the Andalusians driven out of Spain, landed there at the beginning of the 17th century, it took the name of Kasba Andalouse and even became an autonomous republic of corsairs (with Salé) from 1621 to 1647. It was in 1833, when the Oudaya tribe driven out of Fez by Sultan Moulay Abderrahman settled there, which was definitely given the name of Kasba des Oudayas (or Kasbah des Oudaïas).

       <p>
        It is among the oldest Moroccan libraries that have formed the modern network of public libraries.
        Created in 1933 by the habous services, it was separated from the mosque and endowed with a modern, rich and multilingual book collection.
        Then it was attached to the General Library which provided it with a copy of each work received as part of legal deposit.
        Restored and fitted out in 1999, it is currently equipped with books and library and computer equipment.
        In January 2002 it was inaugurated by the Minister of Culture and Communication.
        The Bab Chellah Library is currently specialized in the History of Morocco.
